## To Do 📌
This is a list of things I want to do in this project:

- [X] Use a clear naming syntax for my `variables`, `functions` and `modules`.
- [X] Learn to make better use of helper `functions`.


## Description 📝
For this project I decided to work the UX flow of the [Leren bij de OBA](https://www.oba.nl/educatie/leren.html) web page. The page focuses on offering people help with things like the Dutch language, computers and their finances through courses which they can follow. When I first looked at the page I found some things where not very well thought out like the fact that their was no language select option and the very cluttered agenda page. This where some things I wanted to tackle.
